All this in a small and cosy CLI interface so loved by us coders &#x1F609;

#### What in plans?

- #### Search by any of the marks (EXTENSION, FILE NAME, SIZE, TYPE, DESCRIPTION)

- #### Rename any of the previously set marks (EXTENSION, FILE NAME, SIZE, TYPE, DESCRIPTION)
Most importantly keep this app as simple and small as possible
